# Archive Directory

This folder groups legacy or auxiliary assets kept for reference but not part of the primary runtime path.

Subfolders:

- deployment: old deployment scripts and guides (sh/ps1) superseded by unified process.
- docker: alternative / legacy Docker assets not currently used.
- scripts: miscellaneous helper scripts retained for reference.
- legacy_tests: exploratory or superseded test scripts.

Nothing here is required for normal training or prediction flows. Safe to delete selectively once fully deprecated.
